            <img src="/images/2.avif" alt="">
            <p class="shorthand">Future Apple's iPhone 16 models for 2024 are already generating headlines, and the most recent information adds an unexpected twist. Tech analyst Jeff Pu of Haitong International Securities, who recently verified the price hike for the iPhone 15, has disclosed that the much-debated solid-state volume buttons are now unlikely to be included even in iPhone 16 variants. According to Forbes, the feature was delayed owing to technical difficulties during mass manufacturing and would not be included on the iPhone 15 or iPhone 16.</p>

            <p class="shorthand">In a vacuum, it's not hard to consider the Galaxy A35 a great smartphone. The all-glass design feels like it costs more than the price suggests, and it checks off a lot of boxes on the specs list. I wish it looked more interesting. Samsung sent me the “Awesome Navy” color, and there is nothing awesome about it; it's quite dull. There's a fun pinkish gradient color called Awesome Lilac that looks far more interesting.</p>
